This project uses a simple RAG pipeline to make LLMs give result from the specific documents. 

What is RAG?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI technique that combines information retrieval with text generation.
Instead of relying only on a modelâ€™s built-in knowledge, RAG:

Retrieves relevant information from external sources (databases, documents, APIs, or the web).

Augments the prompt with the retrieved context.

Generates a final, context-aware response.

This makes RAG especially useful for:

Question answering over large document sets

Chatbots with up-to-date knowledge

Domain-specific assistants
