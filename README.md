This project uses a simple RAG pipeline to make LLMs give result from the specific documents. 

## What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is an AI technique that combines **information retrieval** with **text generation**.  
Instead of relying only on a modelâ€™s built-in knowledge, RAG:

1. **Retrieves** relevant information from external sources (databases, documents, APIs, or the web)  
2. **Augments** the prompt with the retrieved context  
3. **Generates** a final, context-aware response  

**Use cases include:**
- Question answering over large document sets  
- Chatbots with up-to-date knowledge  
- Domain-specific assistants

# Falcon-7B Document Q&A with FAISS

This project is an **AI-powered question-answering system** that uses the **Falcon-7B-Instruct** model and **FAISS** for semantic search.  
You can upload your own documents, ask questions, and get precise answers **along with source references**.

## Features
- **Falcon-7B** model for high-quality text generation.
- **FAISS** for fast document search and retrieval.
- **Gradio web UI** for easy interaction.
- **Source document references** for each answer.
- Local or cloud deployment (Hugging Face Spaces / Streamlit).
